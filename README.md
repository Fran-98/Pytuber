Python automated video creation for youtube shorts

## About this project
First of all, this is a personal project, not intended to generate spam or use it in a disruptive way, just made for *educational purposes*.
It was originally intended as a demonstration and a personal challenge to answer the question "How much of the content on the internet could be generated by IA?" As the technology advances and all the IA tools keep being updated, this question surged while using the now famous chatGPT.

## What I learned
As it is, this project could be upgraded in many ways, it could be as good as some human content creators.
I'm sure that we are close to the days when IA could be generating super engaging content and it could be indistinguishable from what a human could make and we are seeing the first indicators of that today.
